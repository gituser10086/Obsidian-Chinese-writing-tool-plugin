This Obsidian plugin provides two functions:

1. Word count: Counts all characters including punctuation, excluding spaces and line breaks. The same as Jinjiang.

2. Formatting: Removes redundant spaces and ensures each paragraph is separated by a single blank line before and after, suitable for Jinjiang publishing. Accessible from the file's menu.
